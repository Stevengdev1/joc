Learning Activity: Turtle Class

We are going to revisit turtle, but this time I challenge you to name two turtles and have them create two different things. Get creative with it! I'm looking forward to seeing your creativity on discord when you share your final result!

Guidelines:

Use a minimum of two separate turtles
Use at least two different colors
Use more than five method calls

Example ideas: Turtles at war; opposing castles; Country Turtle and City Turtle; David and Goliath; DNA Helix; racing turtles, etc...
