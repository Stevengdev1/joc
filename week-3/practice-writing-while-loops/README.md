Practice: Writing While Loops

1. Write python code to print the following using while loops:
   a. 1 2 3 4 5
   b. 2 5 8 11
   c. -10 -8 -6 -4 -20
   d. \***\* \*\*** \***\* \*\***

2. Write a while loop that prints the letters in “CSCI150” on separate lines.

3. Create a program that allows the user to enter in a list of numbers, prints them out in sorted order, and prints the sum and average of the numbers. Prompt the user to continue entering numbers, and enter the number ‘0’ when finished. Then run the program to test the result.
